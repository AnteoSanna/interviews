617 N 23rd Street, Unit 105, Milwaukee, WI.

There has been an active water leak in the hallway of my unit for the past  THREE days, and the issue is ongoing. The leak has not been repaired and continues to cause water intrusion. water is leaking out the light fixture!

I have made multiple attempts to contact my property management company, Berrada Properties, regarding this emergency maintenance issue. No response or repair has been made, despite the seriousness of the situation. I even spoke with someone in person

This condition is affecting the habitability and safety of my home, and I am concerned about potential water damage, mold, and electrical hazards.

I am requesting an urgent inspection and enforcement action due to the landlord’s failure to address this emergency repair.

I can provide photos, videos, and documentation of the leak and my attempts to contact management upon request.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.""2026-01-08 00:00:00","205 W ALLERTON AV, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53207-4911","Leaf/Leaves Pickup Request","","The whole block never got leaves collected""2026-01-08 00:00:00","4161 N RICHARDS ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53212-1011","Area Dark","2026-01-08 00:00:00","Richards street, street lights are out, Capitol Drive to the North, Hope street also out.

There has never been signage here and it seems completely obvious to me, however, for some reason for the last few months, maybe once a week I will encounter a driver who thinks you can turn left from either lane. The left lane has the option to go straight, so you can see why this could be an issue if the left lane decides to go straight and the right lane decides to turn left. It makes no sense to me, maybe people are just becoming less intelligent. It’s never been an issue in the 5 years I’ve lived here but it’s frequent now for whatever reason. We may need to adapt to the decline in driving skills and install signs or paint arrows on the road. In case it’s relevant, it does not seem to matter whether or not there are other several vehicles waiting at the light or not.
